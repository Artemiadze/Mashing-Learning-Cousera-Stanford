This is a repository for my implementations, notebooks, and notes on the Machine Learning course of Stanford University/Coursera.

Taught by [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## 📌 Description
This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **Machine Learning** course by Stanford University, taught by **Andrew Ng** on the Coursera platform.

The course covers key machine learning concepts, including:
- Linear and logistic regression
- Neural networks
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Ensemble methods
- Clustering (k-means) and dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Anomaly detection and recommendation systems
